## Course Overview
This class is the second portion of a two-part series in computing applications of discrete structures. Topics include: number theory and cryptography, applications of computer arithmetic, and matrices in computer systems. This class has a stronger emphasis on progamming applications that model the fundamental theories taught in this course. Each programming assignment requires using Python.

Each topic covered in my Discrete Structures with Computing Applications II (CECS 229) course is represented by a folder.
Within each folder are programming assignments that contain relevant exercises related to a particular class topic/section.
