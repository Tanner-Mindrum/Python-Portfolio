# Python-Portfolio
A portfolio consisting of the various projects, programs, and coursework I have created using Python as an undergraduate computer science student at California State University, Long Beach.

Each university course I have taken associated with the Python language contains its own folder.
Within each folder are various projects and assignments related to each class that have been completed in Python.
